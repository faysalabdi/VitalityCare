# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## If You See Source Code Instead of the Rendered App

If your deployment shows raw source code or compiled JavaScript instead of your rendered application, try these fixes:

1. **Check Vercel Function Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the API route handler is properly configured to use Express
   - Verify that your `api/index.ts` file is correctly exporting the Express app

2. **Check Static File Paths**:
   - Ensure the paths in `serveStatic` function point to the correct build directory
   - Verify that the `dist/public` directory exists and contains built client files

3. **Rebuild and Redeploy**:
   - Make changes to the configuration files
   - Run a manual Vercel rebuild or trigger a new deployment

4. **Verify Build Output**:
   - Check the Vercel build logs to ensure that files are being built correctly
   - Confirm that build commands in package.json are generating files in the expected locations

5. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Verify `NODE_ENV` is set to "production" in Vercel
   - Make sure all required environment variables are defined

## Additional Steps for this Specific Issue

If the app is still showing compiled code after the above steps:

1. **Clear Vercel Cache**:
   - In the Vercel dashboard, go to Project Settings > General
   - Find and click "Clear Cache and Redeploy"

2. **Verify Routes in vercel.json**:
   - Make sure the order of routes is correct (API routes should come before static routes)
   - Check that the wildcards and destinations are properly configured

3. **Check File Paths**:
   - Ensure the path to static files is `dist/public` not just `dist`
   - Verify that the index.html file is correctly located

4. **Debugging Tip**:
   - Add console logs at strategic points in your server code 
   - Check the Vercel Function logs in the dashboard for any errors

## If Problems Persist

As a last resort, you may need to:

1. Create a simpler Express server setup specifically for Vercel
2. Consider using Vercel's built-in support for Next.js or a simpler static site deployment
3. Contact Vercel support with details of your deployment issues
