# Favicon Generation Instructions

To generate the required favicon files from your logo:

1. Visit [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) or [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)

2. Upload your logo file (`logo.png`)

3. Configure settings:
   - For best results, crop the image to make it circular like in your screenshot
   - Use the green color from your branding (#7BC043) as the background color

4. Download the generated favicon package

5. Extract and replace these files in this directory:
   - favicon.ico
   - favicon-16x16.png
   - favicon-32x32.png 
   - apple-touch-icon.png
   - android-chrome-192x192.png
   - android-chrome-512x512.png

6. No need to change the site.webmanifest file as it's already set up correctly.

Once you've replaced these files, your website will display the favicon in browser tabs, bookmarks, and when added to mobile home screens.
