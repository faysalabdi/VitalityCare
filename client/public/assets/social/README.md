# Social Sharing Image

This directory contains:

1. `social-banner.html` - An HTML template to generate a beautiful social sharing image
2. `social-share.png` - The current social sharing image used for link previews

## How to Update the Social Sharing Image

If you want to create a new social sharing image:

1. Open the `social-banner.html` file in a web browser
2. Take a screenshot of the banner (make sure it's 1200x630px for optimal display)
3. Save the screenshot as `social-share.png` in this directory
4. Build and deploy the site

This ensures that when your website links are shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or in messaging apps, they'll display with an attractive, branded preview image instead of a generic thumbnail.
